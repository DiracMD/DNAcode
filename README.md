## Description

This repository is used to support the following work:

### Molecular convolutional neural networks with DNA regulatory circuits
Xiewei Xiong, Tong Zhu, Yun Zhu, Mengyao Cao, Jing Xiao, Li Li, Fei Wang, Chunhai Fan and Hao Pei*

It contains all the codes and data used in this work. 
The raw data can be found at https://github.com/tongzhugroup/dna_comput_rawdata.

## Instrcution for use 
Before your run the code you need to install anaconda[https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html], and then build the environment with `conda`

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml -n dnacode
```
After the environment configuration is complete, you can open jupyter-notebook to run the code
```sh
conda activate dnacode
cd coderaw
jupyter-notebook
```
